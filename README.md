# Neural-Network

My first successful attempt at making feedforward and convolutional neural networks. Any discrepancies in code are due to 
rapid prototyping process and the fact that the purpose of making this was purely educational.

Possible Optimizations:
GPU matrix operations or other form of parallelization
Other optimizers: AdaGrad, Nesterov, etc.
Decrease abstraction by replacing Neuron class with weight/bias vectors
