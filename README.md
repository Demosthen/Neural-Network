# Neural-Network

My first successful attempt at making feedforward and convolutional neural networks. Computation of gradients between two convolutional layers not implemented; one convolutional layer was sufficient for the task I used this for

Possible Optimizations:
GPU matrix operations, multithreading, or other form of parallelization
Other optimizers: AdaGrad, Nesterov, etc.
